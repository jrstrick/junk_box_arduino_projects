**Junkbox Arduino Projects**
These files are the sourcecode for all the projects in my book Junk Box Arduino: Ten Projects in Upcycled Electronics. They *should* be exactly the same code as in the book and in the Apress archive.
Note that these sketches *require* the Cestino Arduino compatible, although they could be ported to work on a Mega without too much trouble.

To install, drop these projects in your arduino sketchbook directory.
